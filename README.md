# Fantasy football consolation bracket

Yahoo stopped doing consolation brackets for the teams that did not make the playoffs (at least in my 14-team league w/ 8 playoff teams). The scripts in this repository scrape the team rosters and write the results into a Google spreadsheet where I track the consolation bracket.
