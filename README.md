# Fantasy football consolation bracket

Yahoo stopped doing consolation brackets for the teams that did not make the playoffs (at least in my 14-team league w/ 8 playoff teams). I set up a consolation bracket so the teams that missed the playoffs could stay involved.

## 2018

In 2018 I'm attemting to fully automate the bracket with an R Shiny app. As of now, it is VERY MUCH a work in progress.

## 2017

In 2017 I use a Python script to scrape stats from the team roster pages and write them to a Google spreadsheet. I manipulated the spreadsheet to arrange the brackets and manually set the matchups. The script had to be running on my laptop while games were in progress in order to keep the stats refreshed. The process of writing to a Google spreadsheet is also a bit slow in Python. (This is also the first large-ish thing I coded in Python and I'd do a lot of little things differently if I did it now.)
